Litematica
==============
Litematica is a client-side Minecraft mod using LiteLoader by [maruohon](https://github.com/maruohon).
It is more or less a re-creation of or a substitute for [Schematica](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/schematica).
This fork was made for players of 20w14infinite and specifically Simply Infinite, an optimization modpack for 20w14infinite.
For compiled builds (= downloads), see https://github.com/ConGodsted/Litematica-Infinite/releases

Compiling
=========
Compiling isn't as straightforward as with the official release, as official versions of malilib and Mod Menu aren't available on either of the mavens.
In order to compile this version, you'll need to supply local versions of these files.
